# STA-363-Project-2

A Project in the course STA 363 in my freshman year at Miami University. In part 1, I manage and clean the data provided, as well as select different EDA graphs that are of best fit. I then build different models using class knowledge in order to find the best model to predict the Spotify popularity score using known predictor variables. In part 2, I set up model validations and explore other model types, then do the real prediction. I came in third place for our prediction accuracy, measured by RMSE.
